# ⚛️ Physics Learning Standard (v1.5.0)

> **Engineering Standards & Reference Architecture for the Physics Learning Ecosystem**

This skill defines the official engineering standards, reference architecture, and development guidelines for all physics learning modules.

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Principles

1. **Domain First**: The Physics Domain is the center of the system. Educational logic and scientific calculations must remain strictly independent of UI, Canvas rendering, or external frameworks.
2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Physics Domain** (`src/physics/`): Pure calculation functions and physics models ($c = f\lambda$, $I = I_0 \cos^2\theta$, $E = hf$).
   - **Application Services** (`src/application/`): Simulator orchestrators, workflow control, quiz/exam logic.
   - **Adapters** (`src/adapters/`): Canvas rendering (`canvas/`), KaTeX formula rendering (`formula/`), LocalStorage (`storage/`), UI controls (`ui/`).
   - **Shared & Utilities** (`src/shared/`, `src/utils/`): Constants, RNG, helper functions.
3. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies always flow inward toward the Physics Domain:
   `UI -> Adapters -> Application Services -> Physics Domain`
4. **Learning First**: Every engineering decision should prioritize educational clarity over technical complexity.
5. **Accessibility by Default**: Ensure keyboard navigation, clear visual contrast, and readable formula presentation.
