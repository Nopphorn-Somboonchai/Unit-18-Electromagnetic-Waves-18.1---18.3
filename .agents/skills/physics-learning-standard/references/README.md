# Physics Learning Standard

> **Official Engineering Standards for the Physics Learning Ecosystem**

The **Physics Learning Standard** repository serves as the **single source of truth** for engineering practices, architectural guidelines, development standards, and documentation conventions across the entire Physics Learning Project.

Every repository within the ecosystem should reference and follow the standards defined here to ensure consistency, maintainability, scalability, and long-term sustainability.

---

# Vision

Build a consistent, scalable, maintainable, and high-quality Physics Learning ecosystem through a unified engineering standard.

Our goal is to ensure that every learning module, simulation, library, and shared component follows the same architectural principles and development practices, creating a seamless experience for both developers and learners.

---

# Mission

This repository exists to:

* Define engineering standards for all repositories.
* Establish a common software architecture.
* Maintain consistent project structures.
* Standardize documentation.
* Define coding conventions.
* Promote maintainable and scalable software.
* Improve collaboration across repositories.
* Provide a common reference for AI-assisted development.

---

# Why This Repository Exists

As projects grow, individual repositories naturally evolve in different directions. Without a centralized standard, inconsistencies begin to appear in:

* Project architecture
* Architecture enforcement
* Folder organization
* Coding style
* Documentation
* User interface design
* Accessibility
* Mathematical notation
* Canvas rendering
* Naming conventions

Over time, these inconsistencies increase maintenance costs, reduce code quality, and make collaboration more difficult.

The **Physics Learning Standard** repository eliminates these problems by providing one authoritative reference that every repository follows.

---

# Scope

These standards apply to every repository within the Physics Learning ecosystem, including but not limited to:

* Physics Learning Units
* Interactive Simulations
* Shared Libraries
* UI Components
* Physics Engines
* Utility Packages
* Documentation Repositories
* Educational Tools
* Future supporting repositories

# Engineering Principles

The entire project follows a shared engineering philosophy documented in **Principles.md**.

Core principles include:

* Consistency
* Simplicity
* Maintainability
* Scalability
* Documentation First
* Learning First
* Reusability
* Accessibility by Default

All repositories are expected to align with these principles.

---

# AI Agent Compliance

This project is designed to support both human developers and AI-assisted development.

All AI agents working within the Physics Learning ecosystem should follow the standards defined in this repository.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Repository structure
* Documentation
* Coding style
* Software architecture
* UI implementation
* Naming conventions
* Accessibility
* Formula rendering
* Canvas implementation
* Physics correctness
* Units and notation
* Simulation validation
* Dynamic quiz validation
* Timed exam and scored assessment validation
* Validation reporting

Agent-generated code and documentation should comply with these standards unless a repository explicitly defines a justified exception.

AI agents creating or reviewing ecosystem repositories should identify the repository profile and use **Standard-Compliance-Checklist.md** to verify applicable requirements.

Repositories with source code should use **Architecture-Enforcement.md** to review dependency direction, layer responsibilities, and documented exceptions.

Repositories with physics content should use **Physics-Standards.md**, **Units-and-Notation.md**, and **Simulation-Standards.md** to review scientific correctness, unit consistency, notation, numerical tolerance, and simulation behavior.

Repositories with dynamic quizzes should use **Dynamic-Quiz-System-Rules.md** to review roll-number based parameter generation, non-deterministic random values, on-the-fly validation, safety constraints, tolerance, and worked solutions.

Repositories with timed or scored exams should use **Timed-Exam-System-Rules.md** to review exam start screens, learner identity fields, timing, lock behavior, scoring, and submitted result data.

Changes to this standard repository should use **Validation-Workflow.md** and run or document the result of **scripts/validate-standard.ps1** when possible.

---

# Repository Lifecycle

Every repository within the ecosystem should follow the same development lifecycle.

Approved standard changes are recorded in **CHANGELOG.md**.

Significant architectural or cross-repository decisions are recorded as individual files in **adr/**.

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR
Breaking changes to standards.

MINOR
New standards or significant additions.

PATCH
Clarifications, corrections, and documentation improvements.
```

Example:

```text
v1.6.0
```

# Contributing

Contributions to the engineering standards are welcome.

Before proposing changes:

1. Review the existing documentation.
2. Ensure the proposal aligns with the project's engineering principles.
3. Document the rationale for the change.
4. Update related standards if necessary.
5. Record significant architectural decisions in **adr/** according to **Decision-Records.md**.
6. Update **CHANGELOG.md** and **VERSION.md** when the change affects the approved standard version.
7. Run or document validation according to **Validation-Workflow.md**.

Consistency across the ecosystem should always take priority over individual repository preferences.

---

# Guiding Philosophy

This repository is more than a collection of documentation.

It is the engineering foundation of the entire Physics Learning ecosystem.

Every standard exists to support three primary goals:

* Build software that is easy to understand.
* Build software that is easy to maintain.
* Build software that improves the learning experience.

Engineering decisions should always serve educational quality first.
