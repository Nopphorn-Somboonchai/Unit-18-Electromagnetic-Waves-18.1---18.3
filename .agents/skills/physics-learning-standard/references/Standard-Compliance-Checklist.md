# Standard Compliance Checklist

> Profile-based compliance checklist for repositories in the Physics Learning Ecosystem.

This document helps maintainers, contributors, and AI agents verify whether a repository follows the Physics Learning Standard.

---

# Purpose

The goal of compliance is consistency, not bureaucracy.

A repository is compliant when it clearly follows the standards that apply to its selected repository profile and documents any justified exceptions.

---

# How to Use This Checklist

1. Select the repository profile from `Repository-Profiles.md`.
2. Review the universal checklist.
3. Review the checklist for the selected profile.
4. Mark each item as `Pass`, `Partial`, `Fail`, or `Not applicable`.
5. Add short notes for `Partial`, `Fail`, or `Not applicable`.
6. Fix issues or document justified exceptions.

# Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Pass` | The repository satisfies the requirement. |
| `Partial` | The repository partly satisfies the requirement, but work remains. |
| `Fail` | The repository does not satisfy the requirement. |
| `Not applicable` | The requirement does not apply to the selected profile. |

---

# Compliance Result

Use one of these result labels:

| Result | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Compliant` | All required applicable items pass. |
| `Conditionally compliant` | Required items mostly pass, but documented improvements remain. |
| `Not compliant` | One or more required applicable items fail without justification. |
| `Not assessed` | The repository has not been checked yet. |

# Compliance Rules

- A repository should not be marked `Compliant` if required applicable items fail.
- A `Not applicable` item should include a reason when the reason is not obvious.
- Compliance should be based on the repository's selected profile.
- Compliance should not force unnecessary folders, tests, simulations, or learning context into repositories where they do not apply.
- Documentation should be updated when compliance status changes.
